!2 Downloading and Installing FitNesse
It really takes very little time and effort to get FitNesse running on your machine.
 1 Go to !style_code(http://fitnesse.org/FrontPage.FitNesseDevelopment.DownLoad) and click on the most recent !style_code(fitnesse.jar) file.
  * If this is a brand new installation, just put it in some convenient empty directory.
  * If this is an update, then copy it on top of the old fitnesse.jar in your current installation.
 2 Type !style_code(java -jar fitnesse.jar)
  * It will ask you to be patient as it installs or updates.
  * When it's done, it will ask you to reload fitnesse.  Type !style_code(java -jar fitnesse.jar) again.
  * If you have nothing running on port 80 on your machine, you should see a message similar to the following:
   * !style_code(Fitnesse (''date code'')) !style_code( Started...)
   * !style_code(on port      80)
   * !style_code(using path   '.')
   * !style_code(using dir    '!-FitNesseRoot-!')
   * !style_code(Not logging.)
  * If you don't see this, you may have something running on port 80 already,
   * So try the command !style_code(java -jar fitnesse.jar -p 8080)
   * If you are still having trouble then check out FitNesseWontStart.

 4 Start up a browser and go to !style_code(http://localhost)
  * ''or if you had to edit run.bat in step 3 then go to !style_code(http://localhost:8080).''
 5 The main FitNesse screen should come up. That's it. You're ready to start using FitNesse.

!2 Learning More
If you have not yet done so, check out the TwoMinuteExample. To learn more about what FitNesse acceptance testing is all about, see AcceptanceTests.  If you are ready to start creating FitNesse pages and test tables, check out EditingFitNessePages and CreatingTestTables.

!2 Memory Issues.
With the 20090320 release, some operations in !-FitNesse-! take more than the default memory allocated to the JVM.  This can cause tests to fail for ''out of heap space'' reasons.  You can fix this by adding the !style_code(!--Xmx100M-!) JVM argument to the java command line when you start !-FitNesse-!.  !style_code(!-java -Xmx100M -jar fitnesse.jar-!).

!3 Memory issues and the build.
If you build !-FitNesse-! from source, the ant script may fail for ''out of heap space'' reasons.  You can fix this by setting the !style_code(ANT_OPTS) environment variable to !style_code(!--Xmx100M-!).
